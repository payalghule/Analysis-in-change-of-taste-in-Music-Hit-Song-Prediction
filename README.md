# CMPE 255: Analysis in change of taste in Music & Hit Song Prediction

### This project was developed as part of the CMPE 255 Data Mining course under Prof. Dr. Gheorghi Guzun of San Jose State University.

# Introduction
- Determine what makes a song a hit song for a given time period.
- Classify a song as hit or non hit for a time period.
- Extract the ongoing trend of features in a given time period.
- The FP mining helps us to infer what composition of salient features make a good song. 
- We then present a decade wise temporal analysis of the change in trend of the features.

# Dataset
